Responsive Site

1. Responsiveness has nothing to do with speed but how the site adjusts depending on the device or viewport.
2. Bootrap uses Columns to structure the layout. Each Row created, has a maximum of 12 "units"
3. Divide by 12 to figure out your layout: for example if I wanted 2 columns in a row I col-6 is needed because 12/6 = 2.
4. 1 div per row and nest each column with a div.
5. Size attribute lets you specify the columns it will be viewed in that size or larger. Smaller will take up the full width.
6. In order to change as the viewport changes you can stack classes | Example <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6" </div>
